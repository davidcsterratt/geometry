Description: This package makes the qhull library (www.qhull.org)
        available in R, in a similar manner as in Octave and MATLAB.
        Qhull computes convex hulls, Delaunay triangulations, halfspace
        intersections about a point, Voronoi diagrams, furthest-site
        Delaunay triangulations, and furthest-site Voronoi diagrams. It
        runs in 2-d, 3-d, 4-d, and higher dimensions. It implements the
        Quickhull algorithm for computing the convex hull. Qhull does
        not support constrained Delaunay triangulations, or mesh
        generation of non-convex objects, but the package does include
        some R functions that allow for this. Currently the package
        only gives access to Delaunay triangulation and convex hull
        computation.
