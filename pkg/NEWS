CHANGES IN VERSION 0.4.1 - Released 2019/03/27

BUG FIXES

* Fix intersectn() fails when overlapping region is not in positive quadrant
  https://github.com/davidcsterratt/geometry/issues/34
  intersection() would return no intersecting hull for input hulls
  whose overlapping region did not overlap with the postive quadrant
  (i.e. the region where all coordinates are non-negative). Thanks to
  Maxime Logez for reporting the bug.

* Fix nonsensical results from intersectn() in 4D
  https://github.com/davidcsterratt/geometry/issues/33
  intersectn() gave demonstrably wrong results in some cases. This was
  Because of some heuristic (non-Qhull) code in halfspacen which was
  designed to get round cases in which Qhull fails with options "Tv"
  because the hull is very narrow. The solution is to remove the
  heuristic method, and also to fix Issue #34 (above). Before Issue
  #34 was fixed, it was found that adding the "QJ" option could also
  help, and this is now suggested in the error message about narrow
  hulls. Thanks to Maxime Logez for reporting the bug and supplying a
  reproducible example, now included in tests.

CHANGES IN VERSION 0.4.0 - Released 2019/02/18

LICENSE CHANGES

* Following requests by the CRAN maintainers and disucssion on the
  r-package-devel email list, the entire package is now released under
  GPL (>= 3).
  https://github.com/davidcsterratt/geometry/issues/27

API CHANGES

* Default options to delaunayn have been changed
  https://github.com/davidcsterratt/geometry/issues/4
  The Qc and Qz or Qx options have been added as defaults, making the
  default options "Qbb Qc Qt Qz" for 3 dimensions or less and "Qbb Qc
  Qt Qx" for 4 or more dimensions. This brings the R implementation
  into line with Octave, and very similar to matlab and
  scipy.spatial.Delaunayn .

* New argument "output.options" for convhulln() and delaunayn().
  https://github.com/davidcsterratt/geometry/issues/29
  Qhull options which affect output should be put in this string,
  e.g. delaunayn(ps, output.options="Fn Fa")

* The "full" option to delaunayn() is deprecated
  https://github.com/davidcsterratt/geometry/issues/29
  Use output.options=TRUE instead. In geometry 0.4.0 using "full" does
  not give a message or warning; this will happen in future versions

* distmesh2d() has a plot option
  https://github.com/davidcsterratt/geometry/issues/15
  The new plot option (TRUE by default) allows plotting to during mesh
  generation to be suspended, which is useful for running tests. The
  use of cat() has been replaced by message(), meaning messages can be
  supressed, for example during tests.

* extprod3d() has a "drop" option
  https://github.com/davidcsterratt/geometry/issues/16
  Setting drop=FALSE guarantees that the output of extprod3d() is an
  array rather than a vector, even when presented with two vectors.

NEW FUNCTIONS

* New function inhulln() to test if points are in a hull
  https://github.com/davidcsterratt/geometry/issues/1

* New function halfspacen() to compute intersection points of
  halfspaces about an interior point
  https://github.com/davidcsterratt/geometry/issues/25

* New function intersectn() to compute intersection of convex hulls of
  two sets of points
  https://github.com/davidcsterratt/geometry/issues/26

* Functions cart2sph, sph2cart, cart2pol, pol2cart ported from Octave
  https://github.com/davidcsterratt/geometry/issues/14

NEW FEATURES

* convhulln() can produce non-triangulated output
  https://github.com/davidcsterratt/geometry/issues/22
  Thanks to Pavlo Mozharovskyi for pushing code to achive this

* delaunayn() and convhulln() throw Qhull error messages when Qhull fails
  https://github.com/davidcsterratt/geometry/issues/28

BUG FIXES

* Fix for Issue #6072: distmesh2d - convergence problem
  (https://r-forge.r-project.org/tracker/?func=detail&atid=4552&aid=6072&group_id=1149)
  Some parts of the original Matlab implementation of distmesh2d were
  omitted during the translation to R. The effect is not obvious on
  some problems, except for long convergence times due to excessive
  iterations - some do not converge at all. Graham Griffiths made
  changes to the code which appears to have fixed the problem as
  example problems now appear to run significantly faster - even
  faster than those I have run using Matlab. Graham's example code is now included in a test.
  Thanks to Graham Griffiths for reporting this problem and supplying the fix.

* Fix for Issue #30: Move qhull docs to vignettes
  https://github.com/davidcsterratt/geometry/issues/30
  This is a change in response to the way R deals with inst/doc, which
  broke the included Qhull docs.

CODE IMPROVEMENTS

* The 2D tsearch C code has been replaced by a much more efficient
  QuadTree algorithm written in C++ by Jean-Romain Roussel. The
  speedup with uniformly distribued mesh points and search points is
  of the order of 40x. Many thanks to Jean-Romain for the
  contribution.
  https://github.com/davidcsterratt/geometry/issues/9
  https://github.com/davidcsterratt/geometry/pull/8

* The new reentrant Qhull library (current version v7.2.1) is used,
  as a precursor to allowing Qhull objects to be returned and operated
  on
  https://github.com/davidcsterratt/geometry/issues/3

* convhulln() now returns a pointer to the qhull object representing
  the hull.
  https://github.com/davidcsterratt/geometry/issues/2
  This is used in the inhull() implementation

* delaunayn() now returns a pointer to the qhull object representing
  the triangulation
  https://github.com/davidcsterratt/geometry/issues/7

* tsearchn() can take an delaunay object, which should give fast
  performance
  https://github.com/davidcsterratt/geometry/issues/6
  NOTE: This feature is experimental and has only been tested
  on 3D triangulations

* Test added for polyarea()
  Thanks to Toby Hocking for suggesting adding one

CHANGES IN VERSION 0.3-6 - Released 2015/09/04

CODE IMPROVEMENTS

* As per CRAN policies, the title in the DESCRIPTION file is now in title
  case.

BUG FIXES

* Fix for Issue #5738: segfault when run from directory lacking write
  permission
  (https://r-forge.r-project.org/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=5738&group_id=1149&atid=4552)
  Using "." as a temporary directory can cause problems if it is not
  writeable. Now the geometry package uses tempdir(), which R should
  guarantee to exist.
  Thanks to Laura Riggi for reporting this problem.

* Put Robert B. Gramacy back in the author list, after he was
  accidentally omitted when changing to the Authors@R format on
  2014/10/29 (version 0.3-5).
  Thanks to Robert B. Gramacy for reporting this, and apologies for
  the error.

CHANGES IN VERSION 0.3-5 - Released 2014/11/06

API CHANGES

* The default Qhull option to the delaunayn() function is now "Qt"
  rather than "QJ" and degenerate (zero-area) simplices are removed
  from the triangulation, so that all simplicies are non-degenerate.
  This is a follow-up to issue #2009: delaunayn can return degenerate
  simplicies by default
  (https://r-forge.r-project.org/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=1993&group_id=1149&atid=4552). Thanks
  to Rolf Turner for alerting me to the issue. 

* delaunayn() now throws an error if the number of points is less than
  the number of dimensions + 1.

FEATURES

* delaunayn() with the "full" option also returns the areas of
  facets. This is a byproduct of the API change above.

BUG FIXES

* Fix for Issue #2789: inline functions min/max generate linker error
  (https://r-forge.r-project.org/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=2789&group_id=1149&atid=4552)
  Thanks to Bernd Bischl for reporting the problem and suggesting the
  fix.

* Partial Fix for Issue #5738: segfault when run from directory
  lacking write permission
  (https://r-forge.r-project.org/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=5738&group_id=1149&atid=4552)
  An error is now thrown, rather than a segfault. The underlying
  problem still needs to be dealth with.

DOCUMENTATION IMPROVEMENTS

* The meanings of "area" and "vol" in the convhulln return value have
  been clarified. Thanks to Michael Cole for raising the issue.

* The documentation of "cart2bary" and "bary2cart" has been corrected
  and improved. Thanks to Francisco Mendoza Torres for raising the issue.

* HTML documentation has been for validation errors with HTML tidy.
  Thanks to Kurt Hornik and the CRAN maintainers for alerting me to
  the problem.

CODE IMPROVEMENTS

* Tests are now all done using the testthat framework.

* There is now a test to make sure output to file works. Thanks to
  Brian Ripley for identifying the problem while testing the pacakge
  for CRAN.

  tsearchn
  (https://r-forge.r-project.org/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=1993&group_id=1149&atid=4552)
  Thanks to Bill Denny for reporting this and suggesting a way forward
  with a fix. Thanks to John Drake for alerting me to the recurrence
  of the problem and Jon Clayden on the R-devel list for pointing out
  the correct way of testing for ill-conditioned matrices.

* Fix for Issue #2009: delaunayn can return degenerate simplicies by
  default
  (https://r-forge.r-project.org/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=1993&group_id=1149&atid=4552)
  This is a follow-on of #1993, so thanks to Bill Denny for
  highlighting the issue.

* Fix for Issue #2007: Qt option given to Qhull
  (https://r-forge.r-project.org/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=2007&group_id=1149&atid=4552)

* The use of the multicore package in tests has been replaced by use
  of the parallel package. Thanks to Kurk Hornik for pointing this
  out.

OTHER CHANGES

 * Updated to qhull version 2011.2.

 * The default qhull option "QJ" for delaunayn() has been replaced by
   "Qt". One or other option is always provided to the qhull code (see
   https://r-forge.r-project.org/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=1915&group_id=1149&atid=4552).

 * Documentation improvements.

 * Added some tests.

CHANGES IN VERSION 0.2-0  - Released 2011/09/09

NEW FEATURES

 * The tsearch and tsearchn functions have been ported from
   Octave. These functions have the same syntax as the Octave
   versions, though it also possible to get tsearch to output
   barycentric coordinates. tsearch only works for 2D simplexes
   (i.e. triangles), but is fast because it is written in C. By
   default, tsearchn uses the fast tsearch function when presented
   with 2D data.

NEW MAINTAINER

 * David Sterratt has taken over from Bobby Gramacy. Thank-you to
   Bobby for his work on the package.
